    <h1>ABOUT SCOTLAND</h1>
    <p>Scotland, most northerly of the four parts of the United Kingdom, occupying about one-third of the island of Great Britain. 
	The name Scotland derives from the Latin Scotia, land of the Scots, a Celtic people from Ireland who settled on the west coast
	of Great Britain about the 5th century CE. The name Caledonia has often been applied to Scotland, especially in poetry.
	It is derived from Caledonii, the Roman name of a tribe in the northern part of what is now Scotland.</p>

    <h1>A Place for Poets</h1>
      <p>An austere land, subject to extremes of weather, Scotland has proved a difficult home for 
	  countless generations of its people, who have nonetheless prized it for its beauty and unique
	  culture.“I am a Scotsman,” the poet and novelist Sir Walter Scott wrote in the 19th century;
	  “therefore I had to fight my way into the world.” Historically one of Europe’s poorest countries,
	  Scotland has contributed much to political and practical theories of progress: forged in the 
	  Scottish Enlightenment in the hands of such philosophers as Francis Hutcheson, Adam Smith, and 
	  David Hume, who viewed humankind as a product of history and the “pursuit of happiness” as an
	  inalienable right, this progressive ideal contributed substantially to the development of modern
	  democracy. Scots have also played a vital role in many of the world’s most important scientific
	  and technological innovations, with inventors, engineers, and entrepreneurs such as Alexander
	  Graham Bell, James Watt, Andrew Carnegie, and John McAdam extending Scotland’s reach far beyond
	  the small country’s borders.</p>
          <p>Hardworking, practical, and proud of their traditions, the Scots have
		  a reputation for thrift that verges on miserliness. Travelers to the country,
		  however, often remark on the generosity and friendliness of their hosts, as
		  well as on the vibrancy of contemporary Scottish culture. An ancient Gaelic 
		  song, a blessing on cattle and the people who keep them, speaks to that
		 hospitality in a sometimes inhospitable landscape:</p>
            <p>Pastures smooth, long, and spreading,
		    Grassy meads aneath your feet,
		    The friendship of God the Son to bring you home
		   To the field of the fountains,
		   Field of the fountains.
		   Closed be every pit to you,
		   Smoothed be every knoll to you,
		   Cosy every exposure to you,
		   Beside the cold mountains,
		   Beside the cold mountains.</p>

    <h1>Land of Scotland</h1>
	<h3>Climate, Plant and Animal life</h3>
    <p>Scotland is bounded by England to the south, the Atlantic Ocean to 
	the west and north, and the North Sea to the east. The west coast is 
	fringed by deep indentations (sea lochs or fjords) and by numerous 
	islands, varying in size from mere rocks to the large landmasses of Lewis and Harris, Skye, and Mull.</p>
	  <p>Scotland has a temperate oceanic climate, milder than might be expected from its latitude.
	  Despite its small area, there are considerable variations. Precipitation is greatest in the 
	  mountainous areas of the west, as prevailing winds, laden with moisture from the Atlantic,
	  blow from the southwest. East winds are common in winter and spring, when cold, dry continental
	  air masses envelop the east coast. Hence, the west tends to be milder in winter, with less 
	  frost and with snow seldom lying long at lower elevations, but it is damper and cloudier than the east in summer.</p>
	    <p>Lower elevations, up to about 1,500 feet, were once covered with natural forests, which have
		been cleared over the course of centuries and replaced in some areas by trees, plants, and crops. 
		Survivals of the original forest are found sporadically throughout the Highlands—for example,
		in the pinewoods of Rothiemurchus in the Spey valley.   Scotland is rich in animal life for its size.
		Herds of red deer graze in the corries and remote glens; although formerly woodland dwellers,
		they are now found mainly on higher ground, but roe deer still inhabit the woods,
		along with sika and fallow deer (both introduced species) in some areas. Foxes and 
		badgers are widespread, but the Scottish wildcat has become critically endangered as
		a result of disease and interbreeding with domestic cats.</p>

    <h1>People of Scotland</h1>
	<h3>Ethnic Groups , Languages and Religion </h3>
    <p>For many centuries continual strife characterized relations between the Celtic
	Scots of the Highlands and the western islands and the Anglo-Saxons of the Lowlands. 
	Only since the 20th century has the mixture been widely seen as a basis for a rich unified Scottish culture.</p>
	    <p>Scotland’s linguistic heritage is complex. The vast majority of the population now
		speaks English, but both Scottish Gaelic and the Scots language have wide influence.
		Languages such as Urdu and Punjabi continue to be spoken by immigrant groups, 
		and the Scottish Parliament provides information in different languages to meet these needs.
		Gaelic, the Celtic language brought from Ireland by the Scots, is spoken by only a 
		tiny proportion of the Scottish population, mainly concentrated in the Western Isles
		and the western Highlands, with pockets elsewhere, especially in Glasgow.</p> 
		<p>Scotland is relatively free from ethnic and religious strife. The Church of Scotland, 
		Presbyterian in structure and Evangelical in doctrine, is the established religion and 
		largest communion, though membership has been steadily declining. It is controlled by a
		hierarchy of church courts, from the kirk session (governing the affairs of a congregation)
		through the presbytery (covering a group of parishes) to the General Assembly, at which
		clergy and lay representatives meet annually in Edinburgh to discuss key issues relating to Scottish society. </p>
